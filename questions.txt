What does the section below the following line in mainSim.py? :
# ---------------- get renewable generation --------------------



Each renewableGenerator should not store the emtire profile for the 8760 hours as they are all the same. 
This can be done at the generationCompany level to save memory and the code faster.



Function in traditionalGenerator.py def "getGeneration(self, demand)" could be done at the generaiton company level to save memory.

Each generationCompany can have a dataframe with the hourly generation by technology type.



why is the bus 0 associated to northem ireland and sometimes to Scotland? This lead to creating 31 energy customers not 30? 



for the electricity generators, the self.ConnectionFee is different for Rgen and Tgen! is it normal?  (0.5174*self.Headroom*0.001-2415.7)/8760 



getGeneration() function in traditionalGenerator need to account for lower capacity factor for Nuclear power during summer


how is the buildrate used? what is done when it is updated?


waste costs are currently not accounted.

busheadRoom is currently not used for the CfdAuction

the predevelopment time is not included in the construction time of any of the plants for the cfd auction, capacity auction, etc.


The derated capacity calculated in getCapYear(self, capYear, deratedBool): may need to be reviewd. How is the derated capacity calculated for renewable energy.
