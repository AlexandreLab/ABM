why is the bus 0 associated to northem ireland and sometimes to Scotland? This lead to creating 31 energy customers not 30? 

waste costs are currently not accounted.

busheadRoom is currently not used for the CfdAuction

the predevelopment time is not included in the construction time of any of the plants for the cfd auction, capacity auction, etc.

The derated capacity calculated in getCapYear(self, capYear, deratedBool): may need to be reviewd. How is the derated capacity calculated for renewable energy.

for already built wind offshore, the amount of cfd subsidy that these new plants receive need to be calculated. see function estimateCfDSubsidy in electricityGenerator.py.


the customer group does not deal with price elasticity or anything at the moment.


testing units need to be developped for each class
